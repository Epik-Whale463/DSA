array:
LL:

cost of accessing an element in an array is constant time
cost of accessing an element in a LL is linear time

memory usage of array is fixed (there might be unused memory left in the array) 
memory usage of LL is dynamic (no unused memory left ) but we use extra memory for pointers

no change of fragmentation 
chance of fragmentation

linear time to insert an element at start
constant time to insert element at start

constant time at end 
linear time at end
